shark-controller-GUI
--------------------

The Air Aquarium project consists on the creation of numerous flying robotic fish (bass, clown fish, shark). These 
fish replicate the motion and behaviour of real fish, but outside the water. The prototypes were made with helium 
balloons, arduino boards, sonar sensors, microphones, among others. Since the sharks contain a bluetooth module, 
they can be controlled through a computer, Android phone or tablet.

The SharkControlGUI, as its name indicates, serves as a remote control for the shark prototype. Only requirement is a
computer with Java installed and a serial port connection to the fish (Bluetooth or direct connection).

Features:
- Allows to regulate the forward speed of the shark
- Send movement instructions: up, down, right and left
- Turn autopilot on and off (for autonomous movement)
- Obtain current readings for forward and height sonars
